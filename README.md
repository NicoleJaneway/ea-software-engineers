## Open Source Projects

Recommended by EA Software Engineers

##### AI Safety

- [AI Safety Info / Stampy](https://github.com/StampyAI/) - "a single-point-of-access to AI Safety, designed to route people to the information they need whatever stage of exploration they are at"
  - You can interact with the wiki [here](https://aisafety.info/)
  - Stampy is a chatbot written in Python which can serve as a conversational interface between a human and AI Safety Info (and more!). Currently, Stampy runs only on Rob Miles' Discord server but he's probably going to invade other online spaces too.
- [DecisionTransformerInterpretability](https://github.com/jbloomAus/DecisionTransformerInterpretability) – mechanistic interpretability of Reinforcement Learning project ([read more](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bBuBDJBYHt39Q5zZy/decision-transformer-interpretability)) (POC: [Joseph Bloom](https://github.com/jbloomAus))
- [Transformer Lens](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens) – library for doing mechanistic interpretability of GPT-2 Style language models. The goal of mechanistic interpretability is to take a trained model and reverse engineer the algorithms the model learned during training from its weights (POC: [Joseph Bloom](https://github.com/jbloomAus))
- [Tuned Lens](https://github.com/AlignmentResearch/tuned-lens) - tools for understanding how transformer predictions are built layer-by-layer

##### General

##### Multiple Cause Areas

- [The Nonlinear Library](https://github.com/Nonlinear-EA/The-Nonlinear-Library) - automatically turns posts from the EA Forum, Alignment Forum, and LessWrong into a podcast you can listen to.
