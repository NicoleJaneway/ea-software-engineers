## Personal Projects

Created by EA Software Engineers

- [Ideact.it](https://app.ideact.it/) – a tool to evaluate different cause areas and ideas by assigning significance values to different variables. The tool tries to combine the [importance, tractability, neglectedness (ITN) framework](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/itn-framework) with personal factors and give a clear visualisation of this. POC: [Zak Watts](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1T11dj1I3c23ZMLGWL-EYZVVJkgOv9coNR1355MWojOA/edit#slide=id.g200427df15d_1_0).
- [elsim](https://github.com/endolith/elsim) – software for simulating elections and evaluating the utilitarian performance of different voting systems, as well as example scripts that reproduce results from computational social choice theory papers
- [Your Project Name]() – a short description about your project

## Open Source Projects

Recommended by EA Software Engineers

##### AI Safety

- [aisafetyideas.com](https://github.com/apartresearch/aisafetyideas) - https://aisafetyideas.com/
- [AI Safety Info / Stampy](https://github.com/StampyAI/) - "a single-point-of-access to AI Safety, designed to route people to the information they need whatever stage of exploration they are at"
  - You can interact with the wiki [here](https://aisafety.info/)
  - Stampy is a chatbot written in Python which can serve as a conversational interface between a human and AI Safety Info (and more!). Currently, Stampy runs only on Rob Miles' Discord server but he's probably going to invade other online spaces too.
- [DecisionTransformerInterpretability](https://github.com/jbloomAus/DecisionTransformerInterpretability) – mechanistic interpretability of Reinforcement Learning project. [Read more](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bBuBDJBYHt39Q5zZy/decision-transformer-interpretability). POC: [Joseph Bloom](https://github.com/jbloomAus).
- [Ought](https://github.com/oughtinc/ice) - https://ice.ought.org/ 
- [Transformer Lens](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens) – library for doing mechanistic interpretability of GPT-2 Style language models. The goal of mechanistic interpretability is to take a trained model and reverse engineer the algorithms the model learned during training from its weights. POC: [Joseph Bloom](https://github.com/jbloomAus).
- [Tuned Lens](https://github.com/AlignmentResearch/tuned-lens) - tools for understanding how transformer predictions are built layer-by-layer

##### Animal Welfare

- [Vegan Hacktivists](https://github.com/veganhacktivists/veganhacktivists) - https://veganhacktivists.org/

##### Climate

- [Code against Climate Change](https://github.com/climateaction-tech/code-against-climate-change) - curated list of tech projects that aim to inspire disruptive technological climate action!

##### Data Analysis

- [Eigen Trust](https://github.com/eigen-trust/protocol) - A distributed reputation system
- [Forecast](https://github.com/robjhyndman/forecast) - forecast package for R
- [Guesstimate](https://github.com/getguesstimate/guesstimate-app) - Create Fermi Estimates and Perform Monte Carlo Estimates - https://getguesstimate.com/
- [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/owid-grapher/) - https://ourworldindata.org/
- [Polis](https://github.com/compdemocracy/polis) - https://pol.is/home
- [Squiggle](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle) - https://www.squiggle-language.com/
 
  
##### Effective Giving

- [Card Generator](https://github.com/TLYCS/Card_Generator) - a free, easy to use eCard creator specifically for people giving to effective charities as gifts
- [Impact Market](https://github.com/impactMarket/app) - https://app.impactmarket.com/
- [Raise](http://github.com/raisenational/raise) - open-source fundraising and giving platform

##### Forecasting

- [Meta Forecast](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/metaforecast) - https://metaforecast.org/

##### Multiple Cause Areas

- [Advice for getting started in Open Source](https://gist.github.com/NicoleJaneway/45069ea3ec808c5507d0e69282976457)
- [eawork.club](https://github.com/henryaj/ea-work-club) - https://www.eawork.club/ - About
High-impact jobs and side projects for effective altruists
- [ForumMagnum](https://github.com/ForumMagnum/ForumMagnum) - The development repository for LessWrong2 and the EA Forum
- [The Nonlinear Library](https://github.com/Nonlinear-EA/The-Nonlinear-Library) - automatically turns posts from the EA Forum, Alignment Forum, and LessWrong into a podcast you can listen to. [Read more](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JTZTBienqWEAjGDRv/listen-to-more-ea-content-with-the-nonlinear-library).
- [The Unjournal](https://unjournal.org): organizes and funds public journal-independent feedback, rating, and evaluation of hosted papers and dynamically-presented research projects. We focus on quantitative work that informs global priorities, especially in economics, policy, and social science. We need software engineers to help us build our platforms (e.g., [our space on pubub](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/), our editorial management workflows (leveraging API tools), and integrate with other communications, meta-science, open-science, bibliometric, and prediction/estimation platforms and tools (e.g., potentially Plaudit, EA Forum, OSF.io, Squiggle, Metaculus, etc.).  We're hiring contractors, and will have more contract work (and volunteer work) soon. (Tags: Research, modeling/prediction, and research impact)

##### Policy

- [PolicyEngine](https://github.com/PolicyEngine) -open-source software to compute the impact of public policy
