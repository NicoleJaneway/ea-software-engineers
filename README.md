## Open Source Projects

Recommended by EA Software Engineers

- [Transformer Lens](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens) – library for doing mechanistic interpretability of GPT-2 Style language models. The goal of mechanistic interpretability is to take a trained model and reverse engineer the algorithms the model learned during training from its weights. (POC: [Joseph Bloom](https://github.com/jbloomAus))
- [DecisionTransformerInterpretability](https://github.com/jbloomAus/DecisionTransformerInterpretability) – mechanistic interpretability of Reinforcement Learning project ([read more](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bBuBDJBYHt39Q5zZy/decision-transformer-interpretability)). (POC: [Joseph Bloom](https://github.com/jbloomAus))
- [Tuned Lens](https://github.com/AlignmentResearch/tuned-lens) - tools for understanding how transformer predictions are built layer-by-layer.
