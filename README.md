## Personal Projects

Created by EA Software Engineers

- [Ideact.it](https://app.ideact.it/) – a tool to evaluate different cause areas and ideas by assigning significance values to different variables. The tool tries to combine the important, tractable, neglected ITN framework with personal factors and give a clear visulisation of this. POC: [Zak Watts](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1T11dj1I3c23ZMLGWL-EYZVVJkgOv9coNR1355MWojOA/edit#slide=id.g200427df15d_1_0).
- [Your Project Name]() – a short description about your project

## Open Source Projects

Recommended by EA Software Engineers

##### AI Safety

- [AI Safety Info / Stampy](https://github.com/StampyAI/) - "a single-point-of-access to AI Safety, designed to route people to the information they need whatever stage of exploration they are at"
  - You can interact with the wiki [here](https://aisafety.info/)
  - Stampy is a chatbot written in Python which can serve as a conversational interface between a human and AI Safety Info (and more!). Currently, Stampy runs only on Rob Miles' Discord server but he's probably going to invade other online spaces too.
- [DecisionTransformerInterpretability](https://github.com/jbloomAus/DecisionTransformerInterpretability) – mechanistic interpretability of Reinforcement Learning project. [Read more](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bBuBDJBYHt39Q5zZy/decision-transformer-interpretability). POC: [Joseph Bloom](https://github.com/jbloomAus).
- [Transformer Lens](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens) – library for doing mechanistic interpretability of GPT-2 Style language models. The goal of mechanistic interpretability is to take a trained model and reverse engineer the algorithms the model learned during training from its weights. POC: [Joseph Bloom](https://github.com/jbloomAus)).
- [Tuned Lens](https://github.com/AlignmentResearch/tuned-lens) - tools for understanding how transformer predictions are built layer-by-layer

##### Effective Giving

- [Raise](http://github.com/raisenational/raise) - open-source fundraising and giving platform

##### Multiple Cause Areas

- [Advice for getting started in Open Source](https://gist.github.com/NicoleJaneway/45069ea3ec808c5507d0e69282976457)
- [The Nonlinear Library](https://github.com/Nonlinear-EA/The-Nonlinear-Library) - automatically turns posts from the EA Forum, Alignment Forum, and LessWrong into a podcast you can listen to.
